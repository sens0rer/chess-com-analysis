# chess-com-analysis
A project aimed at extracting and analyzing my historical game data from chess.com.
Using the scraper requires having a chess.com membership!
Documentation is to come in the future, for now there are docstrings for every function and an example file that will find all your brilliant moves in the last 50 games.
Note: if you have asyncio errors, you might need to install nest_asyncio and add nest.asyncio.apply() at the start of your code.
